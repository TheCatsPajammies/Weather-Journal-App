# Weather-Journal-App
This is the 3rd project for the Udacity Frontend Web Development program. The goal of this project is to make an application that calls the openweathermap api
based on the user's zipcode. The user is asked to input their feelings and zipcode into the entry fields for submission. Once their data is submitted the 
temperature data along with their input is displayed dynamically in the browser.
